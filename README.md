ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m @MuhammadYasirSiraj** â€” a data professional who doesnâ€™t just analyze data, but architects the entire flow. From data warehousing and ETL to modeling, analysis, and storytelling, I design systems that turn raw information into business intelligence.

Armed with SQL, Python, and advanced visualization, I build solutions that donâ€™t just explain the data â€” they move businesses to act, scale, and compete smarter.
